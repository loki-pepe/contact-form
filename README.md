## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I have learned the basics of using ARIA attributes to improve form accessibility, most notably to cater to screen readers. Specifically, I have used the following attributes:
- `aria-hidden` to hide visual content from screen readers
- `aria-live` to denote elements whose content change should be announced by screen readers
- `aria-invalid` to denote an invalid input
- `aria-describedby` to create connections between invalid inputs and the corresponding error messages.

### Continued development

I plan on focusing further on learning about accessibility tools, as I firmly believe the web should be accessible to all. Next time, I will perhaps omit the native `required` attribute and handle form validation solely using custom code.
